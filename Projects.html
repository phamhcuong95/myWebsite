  <div class="desc">A few years ago, my friend and I created a private server for a popular game called Garry Mod. We work on how to host our own game server and our own game website using hosting services like HostGator and firebase. I got to learn Lua and C++ when working on the server. We also were able to make profit from the donations from the players in our server.</div>
